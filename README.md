# Smart-Stopwatch-alarm-clock-project
- Objective: To design and implement a digital stopwatch with two operational modes: counting up (increment mode) and counting down (countdown mode). The project utilizes an ATmega32 microcontroller, six multiplexed seven-segment displays (common anode), and multiple push buttons for user interaction.
- Project Overview: This project involves creating a versatile stopwatch that operates in two distinct modes:
1. Increment Mode (Default): The stopwatch counts upwards from zero, displaying hours, minutes, and seconds on six seven-segment displays.
2. Countdown Mode: The stopwatch counts downwards from a user-defined time, functioning as a countdown timer.
- Features:
1) Reset Function: Resets the time to zero in both modes.
2) Pause Function: Pauses the time counting, allowing the stopwatch to hold its current value.
3) Resume Function: Resumes counting from the paused time.
4) Mode Toggle: Switches between increment and countdown modes.
